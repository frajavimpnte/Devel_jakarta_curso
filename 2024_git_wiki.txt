Initializing a Git repository ---------------------------------------------------
Initialize the local directory as a Git repository. By default, the initial  
branch is called main. If you’re using Git 2.28.0 or a later version, you can set the name of the default branch using -b.
	git init -b main

If you’re using Git 2.27.1 or an earlier version, you can set the name of the 
default branch using git symbolic-ref.
	git init && git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main

	git add .
	git commit -m "First commit"

Adding a local repository to GitHub with GitHub CLI -------------------------------
To create a repository for your project on GitHub, use the gh repo create subcommand. 
When prompted, select Push an existing local repository to GitHub and enter the desired
name for your repository.
	gh repo create

Git bash --------------------------------------------------------------------------
To add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed, 
run the following command. Replace REMOTE-URL with the repository's full URL on GitHub.
	git remote add origin REMOTE-URL

To verify that you set the remote URL correctly, run the following command.
	git remote -v

To push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.com, run the following command.
	git push origin main

SCENARIO 1 Synchronize Local and Remote Repositories------------------------------

1. Create local repository
2. Create remote repository
3. How to Tell Git about GitHub
  git remote add NICKNAME-gh URL-REPO
  git remote

in example
  git remote add recipes-gh https://github.com/DeborahK/recipes.git
  git remote

4. How to Synchronize Local and Remote Repositories
   To synchronize our local and remote repositories, we first fetch the change history 
   from the remote repository and merge it into our local repository using the pull command. 
   Then we push our local change history to the remote repository using the push command. First time:	
   	git pull NICKNAME-gh main --allow-unrelated-histories
   	git pull recipes-gh main --allow-unrelated-histories

   After the first time, the git pull command doesn't require that flag:
	git pull recipes-gh main

   Next, we push the change history from our local repository to our remote repository 
   using the push command.
	git push recipes-gh main

SCENARIO 2 Synchronize Local and Remote Repositories------------------------------
FORK:
	git clone https://github.com/DeborahK/recipes.git

To keep them in sync, we use 
        git pull
	git push

If you are working with a remote repository that you don't own, you may not have access 
to push your changes directly to the repository. Instead, you'll need to issue a 
	pull request

!!! A pull request, or PR, tells the owners or other contributors that you've pushed 
    changes and you're requesting that those changes be reviewed and pulled, or merged, 
    into the remote repository.
